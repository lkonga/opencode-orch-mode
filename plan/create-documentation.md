# Documentation Plan for OpenCode ORCH Mode

## Section 1: Problem Analysis and Solution Approach

### What's wrong:
- No project overview → Users don't understand what ORCH mode does
- Missing setup instructions → New users can't get started
- Undocumented ORCH workflow → Confusion about how agents work together
- Unclear agent roles → Users don't know what each agent does
- No usage examples → Users can't see how to implement features
- No contribution guidelines → Contributors don't know how to participate

### How to fix:
- Create comprehensive README.md → Provide project overview and quick start
- Document ORCH workflow → Explain step-by-step orchestration process
- Detail agent configurations → Show how implementor and reviewer agents work
- Add setup guide → Include installation and configuration steps
- Provide usage examples → Show real-world implementation scenarios
- Add contribution guidelines → Explain how to contribute to the project

## Section 2: Detailed Implementation Plan

### Files to be edited/created:

#### 1. README.md (update/create)
- **Why**: Main entry point for project documentation
- **Content**: Project overview, quick start, installation, usage examples
- **Location**: Repository root

#### 2. docs/ directory (create)
- **Why**: Organize documentation separately from code
- **Structure**:
  - `docs/orch-workflow.md` - Detailed ORCH workflow explanation
  - `docs/agent-configuration.md` - Agent roles and setup
  - `docs/usage-examples.md` - Practical implementation examples
  - `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines

#### 3. example-usage-guide.md (update)
- **Why**: Already exists but needs enhancement
- **Content**: More detailed examples, step-by-step tutorials

#### 4. agents/ documentation (add)
- **Why**: Document existing agent configurations
- **Content**: Explain each agent's purpose and configuration options

### New project structure:
```
opencode-orch-mode/
├── README.md                    # Main project documentation
├── docs/                        # Documentation directory
│   ├── orch-workflow.md         # ORCH workflow explanation
│   ├── agent-configuration.md   # Agent setup and roles
│   ├── usage-examples.md        # Practical examples
│   └── contributing.md          # Contribution guidelines
├── agents/                      # Agent configurations (with added docs)
├── command/                     # Command definitions
├── issue/                       # Issue templates
├── workspace/                   # External agents
├── example-usage-guide.md       # Enhanced usage guide
└── install.sh                   # Installation script
```

### Implementation steps:
1. Update main README.md with project overview and quick start
2. Create docs/ directory and structure
3. Document ORCH workflow in detail
4. Explain agent configurations and roles
5. Add comprehensive usage examples
6. Create contribution guidelines
7. Test all documentation for accuracy
8. Review and refine based on feedback
