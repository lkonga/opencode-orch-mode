# Create Documentation for OpenCode ORCH Mode Project

## Problem Statement

The `opencode-orch-mode` project currently lacks comprehensive documentation. This makes it difficult for new users and contributors to understand:

- What the project does
- How to set up and use the ORCH workflow
- The roles of the agents (@implementor-zai-glm-4-5 and @reviewer-github-copilot-grok-fast)
- How to create and implement features using the workflow

## Requirements

- Create a README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
- Document the ORCH workflow step-by-step
- Explain agent configurations and roles
- Include examples for creating issues and plans
- Add contribution guidelines
- Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and beginner-friendly

## Success Criteria

- Documentation covers all major aspects of the project
- Setup instructions are complete and tested
- Usage examples are provided and functional
- Documentation is accessible in the repository root
